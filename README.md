## About

http://beckdavi.es/flex-dashboard/

Uses flexbox to create a layout for a dashboard, with a variety of columns in full, half, third, quarter and golden ratio widths. The columns contain one level of rows.

The directory is launched in a new tab Google Chrome on port 7777.

To change the browser or the port, look in the scripts section in packages.json and change the values for the browser and the port that you'll find in there.

## Installation

After cloning the repo, run this command from inside the repo:

    npm install

Wait for the node packages to install, then run:

    npm start

The directory listing will open in a new tab in the browser. Click on the file that you want to view (index.html). Henceforth, edit the files in the directory and browser-sync will reload index.html on save.
